mlops_project
==============================

We want to train a model to detect hate speech.
We will be using the Transformer framework, which includes several pretrained models that we want to fine-tune.
Initially we will be working with the Hugging Face dataset: tweets_hate_speech_detection, where every sample is a tweet (string) that are either labeled as hate-speech or no-hate-speech.
For deep learning models we expect to use several models from the [transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto).
